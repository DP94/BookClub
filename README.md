# BookClub

BookClub is a C# RESTful API intended to be hosted on the AWS API Gateway.

#### What does BookClub do?

- BookClub acts as the controller and brains for the BookClubUI Vue.js application. It allows users to CRUD books and view their summaries, who else is on the current book and any comments they might have
- The intended audience for this application is my group of friends, so functionality also exists to allow users to upload images when also discussing the books with others
- With some readers being slower than others, there is also a locking system in place to stop uses from seeing discussions and images which could spoil the content in books they have not read

#### Feature list
- View and filter on books
- Create, update and delete books

#### Planned list
- Interactive scoreboard showing where everyone is on books
- Upload images
